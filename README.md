## Description

The **Travel Guide to Japan** is a web application built using technologies such as Gatsby, React, TailwindCSS, and Google Maps Embed API. It aims to offer users a rich and informative experience while exploring Japan's cultural and scenic diversity.

## Setting up Google Maps API Key

This project requires a Google Maps API Key for proper functioning. Follow the steps below to set up your API key:

### Generating Google Maps API Key

1. Visit [Google Maps API Key Creation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key?hl=pt-br#create-api-keys) for detailed instructions on generating an API key.
2. Follow the guide provided to create your API key.

### Environment Variables Setup

Once you've generated your API key, you'll need to add it to the project's environment files.

#### .env.development & .env.production

1. Copy the `.env.example` file twice and name the copies as `.env.development` and `.env.production`.
2. Open each copied file and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual API key you generated from Google.

### Important Notes

- Ensure the API key is kept confidential and not shared publicly to prevent unauthorized access and potential misuse.
- Review Google's terms of service and usage policies related to the Google Maps API to comply with their requirements.
